# Real-Estate-Legal-Advisor-AI
As part of my AI course, I developed a RAG-based system called "Real Estate Legal Advisor AI" to answer housing-related legal questions in Russia. It combines semantic search over Russian housing laws with YandexGPT to generate precise, article-backed answers. Technologies used: LlamaIndex, YandexGPT, vector search, Colab, Python.
